                     The Apache2Nginx Tool Project

                             August 2012

The Apache2Nginx Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed
at creating a command line tool, which can be used to generate nginx conf file
according to given config files of Apache Httpd.

In addition, serveral users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation 
to the project.  This file is intended to briefly describe the history of the 
Apache2Nginx, recognize the many contributors, and explain how you can join 
the fun too.

In March of 2012, Reed Lee put forwards to an idea which can help people to
migrate web server from Apache Httpd to Nginx.

In April of 2012, Reed Lee developed a prototype, which is based on the source
code of Apache Httpd, and then, James Lee and Youngseok choi also joined.

In August 2012, the version 1.0.0 released.
